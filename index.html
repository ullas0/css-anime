        <p>Monkey D. Luffy was the founder of the Straw Hat Pirates. Influenced by his idol Shanks, Luffy always dreamt of becoming a pirate and starting his own crew ever since he was a kid. Luffy set out to become the next pirate king and told Shanks that he would put together a greater crew than his. That was the beautiful start of the Straw Hat pirates, and Luffy set sail on his own. </p>
